# Fractions Kata in Java

## Goal
Write a program that implements the addition of fractions.

## Constraints
A fraction is a [value object](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html), once created it can't be mutated.

The add method must return a new Fraction object.

Fractions must be reduced. We'll provide an implementation of the [greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) computation.
